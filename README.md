# RPS-Machine-Learning

## Repository Content

In this repository, you’ll find all the code you need to run, locally, a Machine Learning model for the game “Rock–Paper–Scissors” that uses a reinforcement-learning approach. This model goes up against four different bots and wins at least 60 % of the matches against each bot on every run.

## Technologies Used

- Language: Python
- Libreries: NumPy, Unittest
